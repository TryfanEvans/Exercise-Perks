	Exercise Perks offers a variety of different exercise environments including home visits,
	development of home programs, small group classes and one and one sessions to suit
	everyone’s needs. We understand that &quot;exercise&quot; is not for everyone, so our job is to try
	and find some sort of movement that is manageable and enjoyable for each individual. At
	Exercise Perks we encourage long term lifestyle changes by equipping clients with the tools
	and education to manage their own health and well being.<br> <br>
	Georgia returned to Robe in 2019 to establish Exercise Perks after working and studying in
	Adelaide for six years. Georgia is passionate about sharing her knowledge and skills to help
	strive for a healthier community. Georgia has enjoyed returning home to work with
	and meet so many great community members within the South East region.<br> <br>
	Where possible Georgia tries to make exercise as enjoyable and meaningful as possible,
	trying to find some sort of exercise for everyone. <br>
	Georgia works closely with the General Practitioners and other health professionals in the
	area such as Physiotherapists, Podiatrists , Chiropractors and Dietitians to ensure the most
	appropriate management plan is developed for her clients. </p>
