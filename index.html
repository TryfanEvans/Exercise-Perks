						Georgia is very friendly and I have had a nice time chatting with her in the sessions. She makes the effort to
						maintain variety in sessions, even going so far as to take me surfing on occasion. Her knowledge of
						exercise physiology techniques and anatomy allows her to choose effective exercises, which have definitely improved my posture.
						She has been generally flexible with bookings, which has been helpful when an event conflicts with the session.
						Going to exercise physiology is a great way to improve your health and there is no better place for it than Exercise Perks.
